# CarbonCanvas

CarbonCanvas is a decentralized platform on OKT chain for creating, minting, and trading NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) with integrated carbon offset support. Artists, collectors, and creators can use CarbonCanvas to reduce the environmental impact of NFTs by supporting carbon offset projects when minting and trading NFTs on the platform.

OKT Chain (OKTC) is an EVM- and Wasm-compatible L1 built on Cosmos with a focus on true interoperability and maximized performance. At high scalability, developers can build and scale with low gas fees. The OKTC ecosystem and infrastructure, including the all-in-one multi-chain Web3 interface, enables a seamless experience for both developers and users.
